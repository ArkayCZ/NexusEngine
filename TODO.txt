TODO: Replace using GLFW constants for keys in Camera class
TODO: Possibly add some more Key constants in Input class
TODO: Make this work like a library, possibly do some tuning to engine.NexusGame class so that no hacks are needed to use the engine

Things that are wrong:

Important:
-some form of primitive meshes - rectangles, cubes, circles, triangles
-Rendering engine
-flexible level loader


Convenience:
-Better scratchpad support
-automatic shaders
